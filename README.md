## Hybrid modelling for teaching purposes

The idea of this repo to provide a relatively simple approach for hybrid modelling, i.e. creating a model which combines machine learning with domain scientific modelling. In a general sense $y = g(f(x), z, \theta)$ where $g$ is a parametric function with parameters $\theta$ to be learned, and $f$ is non-parametric and to be learned. Here $f$ is represented with a neural net in Flux.jl.
